1. Sum of all elements in a list. 
   This program adds up the list of elements in a list. 
     Initialize a variable to hold the sum of elements. Create a list of numbers, loop through each number in the list and add the current number to the total.
   
2. Check if a number is even or odd.
   The modulus operator gives the remainder of the equation when divided by 2, if the remainder is 0 then the number is even else it is an odd number.
   
3.Compute factorial using a loop.
  Initialize a parameter to 1 since 0! = 1 & 1! = 1. 
  The loop multiplies result to each number from n to 1 and then returns the final computed factorial.
  
4.Reverse a string.
   Initialize an empty string to store the initial result. Loop through each character in the input string from the last to first index. The (lens(s)) function gives the last index and the range() function counts backwards from the end to the beginning. reversed_string += s[i] adds each character one by one to the  initial result.
   
5.Factorial (Recursive).
  Factorial of 0 or 1 is 1. The return statement keeps calling the function until it reaches the base case. The program multiplies the characters from n to the base case.
  
6.Sum of Digits of a Number.
  The operation (number % 10) gives you the last digit of the number. The operation (number // 10) removes the last digit from the number. So every time through the loop: You take the last digit, add it to the total, then remove that digit, this repeats until no digits are left.
